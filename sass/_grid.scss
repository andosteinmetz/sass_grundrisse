* This is a simple system for generating your own responsive grids.
* Rather than creating a grid, these tools allow you to make your own grids as you need them.
* Responsive rules can be declared on a per-column or a per-row basis, as preferred.

/*
*  below is the column generator mixin.
*  the generated styles are percentage-based, and will scale to either the window or their parent element.
*  rows can be given fixed widths in ems or pixels at various breakpoints for a stepwise responsive grid.
*  it takes three arguments -
*  $units: (the number of units the column will occupy)
*  $of-how-many: the number of units in the row, and
*  $gutters (optional): specifying the width of the gutters between columns.
*  gutter width should be given as a percentage. gutters are to the left, and omitted on the first child.
*  if no gutter width is specified, it defaults to the global value provided in "_variables.scss" as $gutter-width.
