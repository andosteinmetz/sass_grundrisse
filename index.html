            <h3>A Simple System for Creating Responsive Grids</h3>
        </header>
    </div>
    <section class="wrapper">
        <p>Having tried out a number of frameworks and responsive grids from around the internet, I felt that what was available was frequently overbuilt, overly-opinionated, and restrictive.
        And, having designed and coded a handful, myself, I found myself repeating tedious work using a variety of approaches to achieve the same ends.</p>
        <p>So recently, I sat down and looked at what was out there, and took what seemed best from those, and rolled what I found into this simple formula for making a responsive grid that suits your needs, whatever they might be, so long as they involve breaking a screen up into proportional sections.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="wrapper">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>The code is written with the following goals in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Restrict the styles associated with the grid to dividing the screen along its x-axis.</li>
                    <li>Minimum markup required to implement the grid. Only two elements: a <span class="mono">row</span> and any number of <span class="mono">cols</span> are required.</li>
                    <li>Rather than supplying a predefined grid, these tools allow you to make your own grids as you need them.</li>
                    <li>Responsive rules can be declared on a per-column or per-row basis, as preferred.</li>
                    <li>The generated styles are percentage-based, and will scale either to the window, or to their parent element.</li>
                    <li>Rows or wrappers can be given fixed widths in ems or pixels at various breakpoints, for a stepwise responsive grid.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's the central code, a single Sass mixin:</p>

                <pre>
@mixin column($units, $of-how-many, $gutter: $gutter-width){
  width: (($units/$of-how-many)*100) - $gutter + ($gutter*($units/$of-how-many));
  margin-left: $gutter;
  float: left;
  &:first-child{
    margin-left: 0;
  }
}
                </pre>

                <p><small>(That's it!)</small> Beyond that, define your own styles.</p>

                <p>The mixin takes three arguments:</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col one-of-three"><strong>$units:</strong> (the number of grid units the column will occupy)</div>
            <div class="col one-of-three"><strong>$of-how-many:</strong> the number of units in the grid row, and</div>
            <div class="col one-of-three"><strong>$gutters (optional):</strong> specifying the width of the gutters between columns.*</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col one-of-three"></div>
            <div class="col one-of-three"></div>
            <div class="col one-of-three"><aside>* gutter width should be given as a percentage.<br>
                Gutters are to the left, and omitted on the first child.<br>
                If no gutter width is specified, it defaults to the global value provided in "_variables.scss" as $gutter-width.
            </aside></div>
        </div>

    </section>

    <section class="wrapper">
        <p>The generated CSS for a two-column grid with 1.5% gutters begins like this:</p>
        <pre>
.row {
  position: relative;

.row:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
